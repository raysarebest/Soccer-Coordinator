 # Soccer Coordinator
 ## *Treehouse iOS Techdegree Project 1*

 You have volunteered to be the coordinator for your townâ€™s youth soccer league. As part of your job you need to divide the 18 children who have signed up for the league into three even teams â€” Dragons, Sharks, and Raptors. In years past, the teams have been unevenly matched, so this year you are doing your best to fix that. For each child, you will have the following information: Name, height (in inches), whether or not they have played soccer before, and their guardiansâ€™ names. All code will be written and executed in a Swift Playground

 ## Requirements

 ***NOTE:*** You can *only* use tools and constructs covered in [Swift Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/swift-basics-2), [Swift Collections and Control Flow](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/swift-collections-and-control-flow), and [Functions in Swift](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/functions-in-swift)

 #### Part 1: Create required collections
 - âœ… Create a single collection named `players` that contains all information for all 18 players
 - âœ… Represent each player with a `Dictionary` with `String` keys and the corresponding values
 - âœ… Store players for each team in collections named `teamSharks`, `teamDragons`, and `teamRaptors`

 #### Part 2: Create satisfactory logic
 - âœ… Create logic that sorts players into 3 even teams, based on player experience
 - âœ… The algorithm must not be based on magic or hard coded numbers or indexes

 #### Part 3: Personalized Letters
 - âœ… Store all 18 letters in the a collection called `letters`, including the playerâ€™s name, guardian names, team name, and date/time of their first team practice
 - âœ… Format each letter
 - âœ… Print each letter to the console
 - âœ… The word `Optional` must not be present in the letter content

 #### Part 4: Naming and Comments
 - âœ… Include comments
 - âœ… Ensure specified naming requirements for constants, variables, keys, and methods are met

 ### Extra Credit

 - âœ… Logic must sort players into 3 even teams based on player experience *and* height
 - âœ… All teams must have an average height within 1.5 inches of each other
 - âœ… Must not depend on initial order of the collection of players
 - âœ… Print average height of each team to the console

 ## Sorting

 Since the extra credit assignment is to basically sovle the [multi-way number partitioning problem](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IJCAI/IJCAI-09/paper/viewFile/625/705), I'm going to be implementing a 3-way version of this problem's greedy heuristic in order to sort the players into their teams so that each team has an average height within 1.5 inches of each other, though my version of this algorithm will be slightly modified to account for setting limits on the number of players and experienced players each team can have. This can be scaled to however many teams we decide there should be in the league, but we've predetermined 3 here

 ### Ordering the `players`
 The very first thing we need to do is sort the `players` array so it's ordered from the tallest player to the lowest player. Given that we're not allowed to use closures or most of the standard library yet, I'm going to make my own implementation of [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort), which operates by iterating over a list 2 values at a time and swapping the values if they're not in the proper order, and reiterating until the array is sorted. It's not the most optimal sorting algorithm out there, but it's simple, and I've never seen a soccer team or league that has millions of players
*/

var hasSwapped = false

repeat{
    hasSwapped = false // Bubble sort knows it's done when it completes a full pass over the array without changing anything, so we need to start fresh after each pass
    for index in 1..<players.count{ // Starting at the beginning of the array,
        if players[index - 1].height < players[index].height{ // If an element earlier in the array is smaller than the one that comes after it,
            (players[index - 1], players[index]) = (players[index], players[index - 1]) // Swap them
            hasSwapped = true // Also, we need to remember the fact that we swapped things on this pass
        }
    }
}while hasSwapped // As stated before, we want this to repeat until we've made a full pass without swapping anything

//: As we can see, our `players` array is now properly sorted, with the tallest kid first and the shortest kid last ðŸŽ‰

players

/*:
 ### Constant, Variable, and Function Definitions

 The gist of the greedy number partitioning heuristic is that we make an array for each group we want to sort into (3 in our case), and then we iterate through the all the players, and assign the next tallest player to the group that has the shortest total height. Given that there aren't any major outliers (which the project instructions say is something we can assume), this should come out to be pretty close to equal in height, most likely within 1.5 inches

 However, it's important to note that there's also a limit to the number of experienced players a team is allowed to have.

 In order to do this, we're gonna need some things that are either not in the standard library or I'm not allowed to use yet, so I'm gonna make a few helper functions. First up, in order to sort players normalizing the average heights of each team, I'm going to need to be able to get the total height of a particular team. For what it's worth, this would usually be a perfect use case for `reduce` from the standard library, but that's one of the functions I'm not allowed to use here, so I'm just gonna roll my own
*/

/**
 Finds the total height of a list of players

 - parameter team: A list of players
 - returns: The sum of the height of all players in `team`
 - precondition: Each player within the `team` must have a non-optional `Double` defined for `playerHeightKey`
 */
func totalHeight(of team: [(name: String, height: Double, hasExperience: Bool, parent: String)]) -> Double{
    var total: Double = 0 // If I didn't mark this as a `Double` by default, it'd be inferred as an `Int` and I'd lose the decimals
    for player in team{
        total += player.height
    }
    return total
}

//: Since we're also not allowed to use `filter` from the standard library in this exercise, I'll have to make specialized versions myself when I need them. In this case, I'll need to know the experienced players on a given team

/**
 Finds all the players that have prior soccer experience in a list of players

 - parameter team: An array representing a list of players
 - returns: An array of all players in `team` that have previous soccer experience
 - precondition: Each player in `team` must have a non-optional `Bool` defined for `playerExperienceKey`
 */
func totalExperiencedPlayers(on team: [(name: String, height: Double, hasExperience: Bool, parent: String)]) -> Int{
    var experienced = [(name: String, height: Double, hasExperience: Bool, parent: String)]()
    for player in team{
        if player.hasExperience{
            experienced.append(player)
        }
    }
    return experienced.count
}

//: So, now that we have most of the functions we'll need, let's get started on actually sorting the players. First, we're gonna need an `Array` that contains `Array`s of player tuples to represent each team's list of players. It goes without saying that since we've decided on having 3 teams in this exercise, we'll need 3 of these team `Array`s, though this can be easily changed for however many teams we want to have

var playerGroups = Array(repeating: [(name: String, height: Double, hasExperience: Bool, parent: String)](), count: 3)

//: I'm about to do a bunch of the same casting twice here, and it's relatively complicated, so I'm gonna make a function to do it. It basically just divides 2 `Int`s accounting for decimals but rounding them back up to the next `Int`

/**
 Divides 2 integers, rounding up to the next integer

 Simply dividing the 2 `Int`s would usually result in floor division. For example, dividing `7` by `3` would usually return `2`. However, this function rounds the other direction, so that dividing `7` by `3` would be `3`

 - parameter dividend: The number to be divided
 - parameter divisor: The number with which to divide the dividend
 - returns: The quotient of dividing the `dividend` by the `divisor`, rounded up to the nearest integer
*/
func ceilingDivide(_ dividend: Int, divisor: Int) -> Int{
    return Int((Double(dividend) / Double(divisor)).rounded(.up))
}

//: We'll also need to hang onto how many players a team is allowed to have. In this case, since there are only 3 teams, each team will contain approximately â…“ of all players in the league. If the number of players in the league isn't evenly divisible by the number of teams, though, some teams might have extras, so we need to know the minimum nuber of players that every team *must* have, and the maximum number of players that some teams *might* have. The difference between these 2 figures should always either be `0` or `1`. It'll be `0` when the players in the league can be evenly distributed into the number of teams in the league, and `1` when they can't and some team(s) will need extra(s). This is achieved by rounding up the `maximum` to the next integer if the players aren't evenly divisible by the teams, and using normal integer division for the `minimum`, which always rounds down

let playerCap = (maximum: ceilingDivide(players.count, divisor: playerGroups.count), minimum: players.count / playerGroups.count)

//: The last major constant we need to know ahead of time is the number of experienced players each team is allowed to have. This is another case where a team might have extras if the number of experienced players in the league isn't evenly divisible by the number of teams, so we have to do all the division stuff from above to get similar information about the experienced players

let experienceCap = (maximum: ceilingDivide(totalExperiencedPlayers(on: players), divisor: playerGroups.count), minimum: totalExperiencedPlayers(on: players) / playerGroups.count)

 ### Player Partitioning

 The last function we'll need for this is one of the 2 greedy heuristic implementations we'll need to make, this one choosing the team the next player will be sorted into by the total height of all the teams. This function chooses the index of the player list in `playerGroups` that has the smallest total height. I'm going to make 2 overloads, where the base implementation takes an array of indexes to choose from, and another one that takes a range of indexes and passes them to the first implementation

//: The last thing we need to do before we actually determine the index we'll be `return`ing is figure out for sure what our choices are.

    The \(team.name)' first practice will be on \(team.practice.date) at \(team.practice.time) at Memorial Field in Drake's Creek Park, and it's mandatory that you and your child must attend. The practice will last approximately 1.5 - 2 hours. Your child will get to know their new teammates and the basics of how to stretch properly and perform a few practice drills, all while you meet your fellow team parents, learn about the upcoming schedule, and how you can best care for and support your child during the upcoming season. Please bring all the necessary release forms that have been sent with this letter. Your child will be provided with a uniform, but we ask that you please bring them equipped with cleats that fit well and shin guards.

    We hope you and your child are just as excited as we are for the new season! We look forward to seeing you at the first practice.

All the best,
